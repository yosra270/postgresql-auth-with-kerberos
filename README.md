# PostgreSQL Authentication with Kerberos

Enabling GSSAPI / Kerberos authentication in PostgreSQL will allow ***single-sign-on*** â€“ i.e. authentication without using the standard username and password for PostgreSQL clients.

## Steps To Setup Kerberos On UBUNTU

Kerberos is a network *authentication protocol* used to verify the identity of two or more *trusted hosts* across an *untrusted network*. It uses *secret-key cryptography* and a *trusted third party* (Kerberos Key Distribution Center) for authenticating client-server applications. Key Distribution Cente (KDC) gives clients tickets representing their network credentials. The Kerberos ticket is presented to the servers after the connection has been established.
