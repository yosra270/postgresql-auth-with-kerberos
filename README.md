# PostgreSQL Authentication with Kerberos

Enabling GSSAPI / Kerberos authentication in PostgreSQL will allow ***single-sign-on*** â€“ i.e. authentication without using the standard username and password for PostgreSQL clients.

## Steps To Setup Kerberos On UBUNTU

Kerberos is a network *authentication protocol* used to verify the identity of two or more *trusted hosts* across an *untrusted network*. It uses *secret-key cryptography* and a *trusted third party* (Kerberos Key Distribution Center) for authenticating client-server applications. Key Distribution Cente (KDC) gives clients tickets representing their network credentials. The Kerberos ticket is presented to the servers after the connection has been established.

*!! Since Kerberos protocol has a timestamp involved, all three machines clocks need to be synchronized.*

### Hostname and IP Addresses

We will start by setting hostnames for each machine :
  * KDC machine       
      `hostnamectl --static set-hostname kdc.insat.tn`
  * Service Server machine        
      `hostnamectl --static set-hostname pg.insat.tn`
  * Client machine       
      `hostnamectl --static set-hostname client.insat.tn`
 
*We can check the hostname of a machine by running the command : `hostname`*

Next, we will be mapping these hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses on all three machines using */etc/hosts* file. <br> 
  `sudo vi /etc/hosts`
  
Now, we should set below information to */etc/hosts* **for all three machines** :

    <KDC_IP_ADDRESS>    kdc.insat.tn       kdc
    <PG_SERVER_ADDRESS>    pg.insat.tn        pg
    <CLIENT_ADDRESS>    client.insat.tn    client

*We can find these IP addreses by running the command : `hostname -I`*

Once the setup is done, we should restart the three machines.

### Key Distribution Center Machine Configuration

Following are the packages that need to installed on the KDC machine : <br>
 `sudo apt install krb5-kdc krb5-admin-server krb5-config`
 
During the installation, we will be asked for configuration of :
 * the realm : 'INSAT.TN' (must be *all uppercase*)
 * the Kerberos server : 'kdc.insat.tn'
 * the administrative server : 'kdc.insat.tn'
 
***Realm** is a logical network, similar to a domain, that all the users and servers sharing the same Kerberos database belong to.* 

The master key for this KDC database needs to be set once the installation is complete :
   
    `sudo krb5_newrealm`
    Enter KDC database master key: 
    Re-enter KDC database master key to verify:

*The users and services in a realm are defined as a **principal** in Kerberos.* These principals are managed by an *admin user* that we need to create manually :

    `sudo kadmin.local`
    kadmin.local:  add_principal root/admin
    Enter password for principal "root/admin@INSAT.TN": 
    Re-enter password for principal "root/admin@INSAT.TN": 
    Principal "root/admin@INSAT.TN" created.

[kadmin.local](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/admin_commands/kadmin_local.html) is a KDC database administration program. We used this tool to create a new principal in the INSAT.TN realm (`add_principal`).

We can check if the user *root/admin* was successfully created by running the command : `kadmin.local: list_principals`. We should see the 'root/admin@INSAT.TN' principal listed along with other default principals.

Next, we need to grant all access rights to the Kerberos database to admin principal *root/admin* using the configuration file */etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl* . <br>
 `sudo vi /etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl`

In this file, we need to add the following line :

    */admin@INSAT.TN    *

For changes to take effect, we need to restart the following service : `sudo systemctl restart krb5-admin-server`

Once the admin user who manages princpals is created, we need to create the principals. We will to create principals for both the client machine and the service server machine.

**Create a principal for the client**

    `sudo kadmin.local`
    kadmin.local:  add_principal yosra
    Enter password for principal "yosra@INSAT.TN": 
    Re-enter password for principal "yosra@INSAT.TN": 
    Principal "yosra@INSAT.TN" created.

**Create a principal for the service server**

For the service server we will be creating two principals :
  * A principal which represents the database user and the Linux login user (we will name it *postgres*): <br>
    
         `sudo kadmin.local`
         kadmin.local:  add_principal postgres
         Enter password for principal "postgres@INSAT.TN": 
         Re-enter password for principal "postgres@INSAT.TN": 
         Principal "postgres@INSAT.TN" created.
    

  * A principal instance for Service server (*postgres/pg.insat.tn*) : <br>
    
         `sudo kadmin.local`
         kadmin.local:  add_principal postgres/pg.insat.tn
         Enter password for principal "postgres/pg.insat.tn@INSAT.TN": 
         Re-enter password for principal "postgres/pg.insat.tn@INSAT.TN": 
         Principal "postgres/pg.insat.tn@INSAT.TN" created.
    

*We can check the list of principals by running the command : `kadmin.local: list_principals`* <br>

### Service server Machine Configuration

#### Configuration of Kerberos

##### Installation of Packages  

Following are the packages that need to be installed on the Service server machine : <br>
 `sudo apt install krb5-user libpam-krb5 libpam-ccreds auth-client-config`
 
During the installation, we will be asked for the configuration of :
 * the realm : 'INSAT.TN' (must be *all uppercase*)
 * the Kerberos server : 'kdc.insat.tn'
 * the administrative server : 'kdc.insat.tn'

PS : *We need to enter the same information used for KDC Server.*

##### Preparation of the *keytab file*

We need to extract the service principal from KDC principal database to a keytab file.

1. In the KDC machine run the following command to generate the keytab file in the current folder :

   ```
   $ ktutil 
   ktutil:  add_entry -password -p postgres/pg.insat.tn@INSAT.TN -k 1 -e aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96
   Password for postgres/pg.insat.tn@INSAT.TN: 
   ktutil:  wkt postgres.keytab
   ktutil:  exit
   ```

2. Send the keytab file from the KDC machine to the Service server machine :

In the Postgres server machine make the following directories :
   
   `mkdir -p /home/postgres/pgdata/data`

In the KDC machine send the keytab file to the Postgres server :

   `scp postgres.keytab postgres@<PG_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>:/home/postgres/pgdata/data`
   
3. Verify that the service principal was succesfully extracted from the KDC database :

   ```
   postgres@pg:~$ ktutil 
   ktutil:  list
   slot KVNO Principal
   ---- ---- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   ktutil:  read_kt postgres.keytab 
   ktutil:  list
   slot KVNO Principal
   ---- ---- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    1    1          postgres/pg.insat.tn@INSAT.TN
   ```

#### Configuration of the service (PostgreSQL)

##### Installation of PostgreSQL 

1. Update the package lists 
 
   `sudo apt update`
 
2. Install necessary packages for Postgres

   `sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib`

3. Ensure that the service is started

   `sudo systemctl start postgresql.service`



##### Create a Postgres Role for the Client 

```
$ postgres

postgres=# create user 'yosra' with encrypted password 'some_password';
```
To ensure the role was successfully created run the following command :

```
postgres=# SELECT username FROM pg_user WHERE username LIKE 'yosra';
```

The user yosra has now a role in Postgres and can access its default database 'yosra'.

### Client Machine Configuration

Following are the packages that need to be installed on the Client machine : <br>
 `sudo apt install krb5-user libpam-krb5 libpam-ccreds auth-client-config`
 
During the installation, we will be asked for configuration of :
 * the realm : 'INSAT.TN' (must be *all uppercase*)
 * the Kerberos server : 'kdc.insat.tn'
 * the administrative server : 'kdc.insat.tn'


PS : *We need to enter the same information used for KDC Server.*
